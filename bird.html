<h1>Where the Water Didn't Reach </h1>
</header>

<main>
	<p>Three star-crossed teenagers stuck in highly conservative 1996 Sylva, North Carolina attempt to navigate the transition from child to adult while in the throes of poverty, self-identity, assault, and religion.
	</p>

	<h2>Titlecard</h2>
	<div id="about">
		<figure> <figcaption>Digital, 3600 x 3335</figcaption> <img src="img/titlecard.png" alt="Titlecard"></figure>
	<div>
		<p>Our protagonists look up at the viewer in a range of amusement, rage, and fear. From left to right, I portrayed the first two with more relaxed body language despite their disheveled conditions. Their knuckles, opposite each other, appear scuffed and bloody, with the middle girl's nail polish chipped, coinciding with her smeared makeup. 
		</p>	
		<p>In contrast, her companion is covered in her lipstick markings - not in spite of their fighting, but because of it. She leans into them regardless. This theme of comfort in violence is discernible amongst multiple works of mine and will continue to be relevant to the plot.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	</div>
<p>On the far right, our outlier is dressed cleanly with rigid, stiff shoulders and clasped hands. He remains unbloodied, bearing a simple cross. Naive and not understanding his peers, it will not stay this way for long.
		</p>

	<h3>(Savior Jesus, Meek & Mild)</h3>
	<div id="about">
	<div>
		<p>Part one of my series on memory. The man portrayed seemingly has not existed for a very long time, but the viewer can take comfort knowing that whatever may have happened, he was happy at some point.
		</p>

	</div>

	<h2>People Like Them</h2>
	<div id="about">
		<figure><figcaption>Digital, 3200 x 2335</figcaption><img src="img/people like them.png" alt="people like them"></figure>
	<div>
		<p>When I first thought of creating this piece, I reflected massively on my own resilience up til now. To grow a teenager, helpless, in a country that despises people like you, like your friends, like your family members, requires a lifetime of pliability that no child should ever have to develop.
		</p>	
		<p>And yet we still flourish. We remain soft, we remain considerate, we remain able to lean on each other, we laugh anyways. In a world not made for the poor or black or disabled or queer, we make our own happiness. 
		</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<p>This work is a manifestation of the indomitable human spirit and stubborn, frenzied teenage resistance through love. I upped the saturation continuously as I worked in order to give the piece a jovial feel, the sun beams proudly as it begins to make way for the moon; Like the last of the sunlight slipping through leaves, their “American Dream” emerges through each other.
	</p>

	<h3>Nowhere, North Carolina</h3>
	<div id="about">
	<div>
		<p>This is part two of my series on memory. Both teenagers look on smiling, a permanent static recollection of their childhood.
		</p>	
	
	
	</div>

	<h2>Jesus on the Dashboard</h2>
	<div id="about">
		<figure><figcaption>Digital, 7400 x 4800</figcaption><img src="img/jesus on the dashboard.jpg" alt="jesus on the dashboard"></figure>
	<div>
		<p>This work conveys the feeling of helplessness. The windshield is obscured, leaving no way to tell where the car is headed. The boy looks back toward the viewer, as if pleading, though the viewer is just as clueless. 
		</p>
		<p>The driver's obscured face adds to the uncertain atmosphere, but is also a metaphor for abuse; The victim is thrown to the world, raw, alone, on display for judgment, while the perpetrator remains anonymous and with dignity intact. 
		</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<p>The boy's expression is frightened and irresolute, tears begin to well in his eyes. The rosary strung up may symbolize protection, but he knows it will not save him, wherever he ends up.
